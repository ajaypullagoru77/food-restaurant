*Shopping Cart: Add, remove, and adjust quantities of food items in the cart, with local storage persistence.
*User Authentication: Register and log in with credentials stored in local storage.
*Payment Processing: Simulated payment form for completing orders.
*Responsive Design: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices with a collapsible navbar.
*Scroll Animations: Smooth section transitions and scroll-to-top functionality.
*Loader Animation: Engaging loading screen on page load.
*Social Media Integration: Links to social media profiles in the footer.
